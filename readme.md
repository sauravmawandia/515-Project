1. Merging Data
2. Data Cleaning — 
3. Sma 250, 50 
4. Total return vs price resturn
5. Individual return($1 investment)
6. Portfolio return (value Investing 
Utilities(30% Tech 50% Banking 20%)

7 - Webull Distribution and Gumbel and Frechet to show that the period has a event, hence this period is robust 

8- Value at Risk — Maximum losses that we can incur

9 Creating Portfolio - Adding Weights  - Annualized Variance and covariance matrix.
10. Tail Risk — chance of a loss occurring due to a rare event. Outlier 

11. Fit Model - GHT, HYP, NIG (Probability distribution) . We will evaluate our prediction using above model and find the best model for our usecase.
